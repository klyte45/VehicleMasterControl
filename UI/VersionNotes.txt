Welcome to the <color yellow>Vehicle Master Control Mod</color>!

This mod is a lighter and fixed version of the old Service Vehicle Manager. Some features were removed due malfunction, but the mod control abrangency has been increased.

Using VMC you can control the spawn of models by district (being the default selection applied to whole city) and also change the color basing on source building's district.

May in the future some feature can come back to this mod, like the model selection by building.

Of course, this mod have support to latest updates of CS, including <sprite SunsetHarborIcon> vehicles.

Use this along with <color #4444FF>Transport Lines Manager</color> and <color red>Vehicle Wealthizer</color> to have full control over the game vehicles, once this mod changes all but the city public transport and citizen vehicles (except bikes, that VW can't handle).

Enjoy!
